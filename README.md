# Game Collection
Welcome to the Game Collection! This repository contains three exciting games developed using OpenGL and C++. Each game offers unique gameplay mechanics and visual styles.

## Games Overview

### 1. Angry Birds Clone

This game mimics the popular Angry Birds gameplay, where players aim and shoot a bird at a balloon (representing the pig) to score points. Players can change the bird's color with each click, and when the bird successfully hits the balloon, a burst animation occurs before restarting the game.

### 2. Star Wars Death Star
This graphics program utilizes OpenGL and GLUT to create an engaging space-themed game featuring interactive planets, a Death Star, and dynamic obstacles like rocks. Players navigate their spaceship while shooting lasers to destroy rocks and avoiding collisions, all within a visually appealing cosmic environment.

### 3. 
This C/C++ program uses OpenGL and GLUT to create an interactive graphical application that features a rocket, a moon, a starry sky, and an open window. Key functionalities include animated rocket movement, random color changes on mouse clicks, adjustable moon size with keyboard inputs, and a starry background, providing a simple yet engaging introduction to graphical programming.
